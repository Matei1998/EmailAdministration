# EmailAdministration
Java project that generates email adresses for employees
This application generates emails following the next syntax : firstname.lastname@department.company.com
The firstname and lastname are entered in the EmailApp class(main class ) as a new Object.
After running the program, it asks us what department is the employee in. You can choose from 0(none) to 3 ( 1-sales, 2 -  development, 3- accounting ).
After that, the program generates a random password of 10 characters and it generates the email address, depending on the department where the employee is hired.
You have functions that allows you to change the password, to set an alternate email, to set the mailbox capacity.
